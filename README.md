I am moving to my own public Gitea instance https://git.quad4.io/explore/repos which is behind a WAF. Some projects will also be mirrored to lavaforge instance: https://lavaforge.org/Ivan

**Why:**

- GitHub AI sloppification
- AI bros
- Microsoft
- I was already using Gitea with push mirrors.

My public gitea instance is also behind Bunkerweb WAF. You will need to contact me over LXMF, XMPP or Email for any issues, ideas or how to contribute. 

**New project locations:**

Reticulum-Go - https://git.quad4.io/Networks/Reticulum-Go
rns-page-node - https://git.quad4.io/RNS-Things/rns-page-node
RNS-over-HTTP/S - https://git.quad4.io/Reticulum-Interfaces/RNS-over-HTTP
