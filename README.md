I am moving to my own public Gitea instance https://git.quad4.io/explore/repos. Some projects will also be mirrored to lavaforge instance: https://lavaforge.org/Ivan

Why:

- GitHub AI sloppification
- AI bros
- Microsoft
- I was already using Gitea with push mirrors.

Dont like it? You can always fork and do whatever you want.

New project urls: 

Reticulum-Go - https://git.quad4.io/Networks/Reticulum-Go
